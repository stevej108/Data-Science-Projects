# Projects:
1. Diagnostic Device Signal Forecasting
   Using a variety of machine learning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and statistical models, electrode signal predictive analysis was executed for a cutting edge molecular diagnostic device.  By employing techniques such as Random Forests and LightGBM models, an algorithm was created to reduce the presence of False Negative signals on the device.

2. End-to-End ETL Pipeline
   A complex ETL pipeline was developed to pull real-time data from a RESTful API, clean, filter, aggregate, and perform statistical analyses, and finally load the output to our Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for advanced machine learning efforts.

3. AI/ML Signal Bleed Algorithm
   Using a variety of advanced machine learning techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost, Ensemble Methods) and data visualization tools, a lightweight algorithm was developed to eliminate off-target electrode signal bleeding present in our medical device.  Employment of the algorithm resulted in a 96% reduction False Positive signals resulting from signal bleeding.

4. Mixed Media Advertising Analysis
   Deep data analytics and predictive modeling was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of various advertising streams on the desired customer demographic.  Additional work was performed to identify which demographic was most likely to result in a conversion for each advertising stream.

5. Marketing Customer Segmentation Analysis
   Using predictive machine learning and clustering techniques, potential customers and customer groups were identified based on a large and complex blend of parameters with the goal of creating a highly focused marketing campaign to attract the customer most likely to convert to sales.

6. NFL Play Exploratory Data Analysis
   Through the National Football League, a deep dive into the presnap behaviors was performed with the goal of play prediction based on nearly 10,000 parameters.

7. Leaf Detection via Computer Vision
   Using deep learning techniques for Computer Vision, a model was developed to identify healthy vs diseased leaves, and resulted in an overall accuracy of nearly 95%.  To assist in explanability, SHAP was employed to demonstrate how the model detected each image.

8. Loan Approval Predictive Modeling
   Machine Learning techniques were employed to assist a financial agency in evaluating risk for loans of a variety of applicants.  By effectively training the model on historical data, a predictive approach was employed to identify applicants which will most likely default on their loan based on a variety of parameters.

9. Cirrhosis Liver Failure Predictive Modeling
    In an effort to help a healthcare corporation, deep learning techniques were employed to identify stages of liver failure in patients.  This work was able to effectively separate and classify patients into 4 stages of liver failure with an accuracy rate of nearly 85%.

10. Amazon Product Recommendation System
    Using advanced AI/ML techniques, a recommender model was developed for selected list of customers based on purchase history, browsing history, customer segmentation clustering, and customer demographics.  The recommender system was effectively employed to promote desired products to the correct customers.

11. Grocery Store Sales Forecasting
    Using exploratory data analysis and machine learning, a predictive model was designed for a local grocery store corporation to assist in identifying store performance across various store locations.  This work allowed for resource optimization by allocating more resources for high performing/high traffic stores, and reducing resources for low traffic stores.

12. Banking Customer Segmentation
    Using a variety of unsupervised ML techniques, customers from a local financial institution were segmented based on a variety factors including bank history, demographics, and banking interactions.  Based on the available data, areas for improvement in how the banks were interacting with customers were suggested to improve customer satisfaction.  Additionally, customers segments were identified in which additional product marketing efforts should be directed.
